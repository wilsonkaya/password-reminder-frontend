<==== User Story === >
-As a <user> I want to <store(create)> website name and keywords, so that I can
reach them wen I need.

-As a <user> I want to <index> webpages and password hints so that I <can remember
my passwords>

- As a <user> I want to <update> my password hints so that <they will be more
actual>

-As a <user> I want to <delete> password hint because <I donâ€™t need it anymore>

<===Development====>
- After having a working api server I have created a basic html so I can do basic

-I have decided to use handlebars for showing data that is returned from api.
It saved me a lot of time from writing extra code for itirating trough the data
and append them into a div.

- I have used different handlebars for "update" and "create" except making a second
get request to overwrite html. This was the hard part because when you over write
html you need to re-assign classes and ids.

- For styling, I have used bootstrap nav-bars, Jumbotron and modals to keep it
simple that I can use my extra time for creating extra functions.

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and Handlebars are the technologies that I used
for this project.
