# User Story

- As an user I want to store(create) website name and keywords, so that I can
reach them wen I need.

- As a user I want to index webpages and password hints so that I can remember
my passwords

- As a user I want to update my password hints so that they will be more
actual

- As a user I want to delete password hint because I donâ€™t need it anymore



# Development

- First I have sacaffold accounts and I have created curl request for each route
- For every route I have defined controllers and I have created their modals.
- After creating the modal I have migrated my database for creating the table.
- I have implmeneted open read controller for my accounts because I don't want people to see data of each other.
- I have spent most of time to intigrate Twilio messaging api to my aplication. I was the hardest part of this project. I have almost red 20 different blogs and whatched 4 different tutorials of people who uses this api for integrating to their app but I wasn't able to do it._
